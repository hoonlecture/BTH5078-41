# IntroR
## Fundamentals of computational data analysis using R

These materials were developed for an introductory class on data 
  analysis using R, but was designed with self-study in mind. The 
  series has been divided into four sections. The first section covers 
  basic programming in R. The second section is an introduction to 
  univariate statistics. The third section introduces multivariate 
  statistics, including generalized linear models. The fourth section 
  introduces machine learning.

The target audience for the course is researchers with basic knowledge 
  of R, comfort with basic high-school algebra, and an interest in learning 
  fundamental concepts behind a broad range of commonly encountered 
  techniques in statistics and machine learning.

The emphasis of the course is on principles and good practices common 
  to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning methods. Random 
  sampling, model selection and model evaluation are emphasized, 
  as are computationally intensive resampling methods. Code examples and 
  exercises (with solutions) are provided to help readers develop practical 
  skill with the methods discussed.
